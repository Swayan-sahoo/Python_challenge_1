Project Overview
This repository contains two Python-based data analytics projects: PyBank_Starter and PyPoll_Starter. Both projects focus on manipulating and analyzing simple datasets with Python.

# PyBank: A financial analysis tool for analyzing budget data.
# PyPoll: A voting analysis tool for calculating election results from a set of voter data.
These projects are designed for educational purposes, demonstrating basic skills in Python for data manipulation and analysis.

PyBank_Starter
## Goals
The PyBank project is aimed at performing a simple analysis of financial records. It processes a set of monthly revenue data to calculate the following:

Total number of months included in the dataset.
Net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
Average change in "Profit/Losses" between months.
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount).
The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount).
Technologies
Python 3.x
pandas (optional for advanced users)
CSV files for input data
## How to Run
Clone the repository.
Run the PyBank script: python PyBank .py
View results: The results will be displayed in the console and optionally written to a text file named PyBank_results.txt.

## PyPoll_Starter
# Goals
The PyPoll project is aimed at tallying votes from a set of election data. It calculates the following:

Total number of votes cast.
List of candidates who received votes.
Percentage of votes each candidate won.
Total number of votes each candidate won.
Winner of the election based on popular vote.
